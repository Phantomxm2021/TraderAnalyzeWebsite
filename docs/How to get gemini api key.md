# How to get a Gemini API key
To get a Gemini API key, go to Google AI Studio (ai.google.dev), sign in with your Google account, and click "Get API key". You'll then click "Create API key," select a Google Cloud project, and copy the newly generated key to a secure location. 
## Step-by-step guide
1. Go to Google AI Studio: Navigate to https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart or https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey in your web browser. 
2. Sign in: Log in with your Google account if you are not already signed in. 
3. Get an API key: Look for and click the "Get API key" button, which is often in the top right corner or under the "API keys" or "Dashboard" section. 
4. Create a new key: On the next screen, click the "Create API key" button. 
5. Select a project: Choose an existing Google Cloud project from the dropdown menu or create a new one. 
6. Copy and save: Once the key is generated, copy it and store it in a secure place. Treat it like a password to prevent unauthorized access and potential charges.
